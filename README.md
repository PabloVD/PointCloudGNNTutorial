## Description

Tutorial on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) using [Pytorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), in a point cloud classification task as a example. Learn how to implement a generic GNN with node and edge models to process 3D point cloud data.

Still incomplete!
